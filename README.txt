In this project I attempt to use a linear regression to forecast the log returns of Bitcoin.


Below are the on-chain metrics used.
AVBLS : The Average block size in MB
BLCHS : The total size of all block headers and transactions. Not including database indexes.
CPTRA : Data showing miners revenue divided by the number of transactions.
CPTRV : Data showing miners revenue as as percentage of the transaction volume.
DIFF : Difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target.
ETRAV : Similar to the total output volume with the addition of an algorithm which attempts to remove change from the total value. This may be a more accurate reflection of the true transaction volume.
ETRVU : Similar to the total output volume with the addition of an algorithm which attempts to remove change from the total value. This may be a more accurate reflection of the true transaction volume.
HRATE : The estimated number of giga hashes per second (billions of hashes per second) the bitcoin network is performing.
MIREV : Historical data showing (number of bitcoins mined per day + transaction fees) * market price.
MKPRU : Data showing the USD market price from Mt.gox
MKTCP : Data showing the total number of bitcoins in circulation the market price in USD.
MWNUS : Number of wallets hosts using our My Wallet Service.
NADDU : Number of unique bitcoin addresses used per day.
NTRAN : Total number of unique bitcoin transactions per day.
NTRAT : Total number of unique bitcoin transactions per day.
NTRBL : The average number of transactions per block.
NTREP : Data showing the total number of unique bitcoin transactions per day excluding those which involve any of the top 100 most popular addresses popular addresses.
TOTBC : Data showing the historical total number of bitcoins which have been mined.
TOUTV : The total value of all transaction outputs per day. This includes coins which were returned to the sender as change.
TRFEE : Data showing the total BTC value of transaction fees miners earn per day.
TRFUS : Data showing the total BTC value of transaction fees miners earn per day in USD.
TRVOU : Data showing the USD trade volume from the top exchanges.
